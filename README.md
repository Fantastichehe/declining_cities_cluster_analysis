# declining_cities_cluster_analysis
K means cluster analysis of declining cities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia


The aim of the current analysis is to identify cities in Eastern European and Central Asian (ECA) countries which have been declining despite the rapid urbanisation processes worldwide. The region was chosen for this study due countries' shared legacy of state-controlled policies on cities and the fact that these countries are often neglected in the literature. K means clustering is used to find clusters with similar attributes.
